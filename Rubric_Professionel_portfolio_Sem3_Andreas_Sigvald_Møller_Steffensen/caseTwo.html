                <h4>Problem</h4>
                <p>The Site did not reflect the true theme of the experience that the sites customers would experience.
                    It also didn't communicate the possibility for large groups to take part in the experience. The
                    general design and functionality were also lacking compared to other competitors sites</p>

                <h4>Solution</h4>
                <p>Make a full redesign of the costumers website based of user research and new UX/UI design theories
                    and methods.</p>

                <h4>Roles</h4>
                <p>UX/UI designer, Frontend developer</p>

                <h4>Research</h4>
                <p>The project is started via customer meeting with GetOut, where we discussed the expectations for the
                    redesign, the customers wishes, general information such as their target groups and values for the
                    company. </p>

                <h4>Quantitative Research</h4>
                <p>Based of the customer meeting and using collected user data, we used segmentation to obtain a profile
                    for the desired target group.</p>

                <h4>Qualitative Research</h4>
                <p>Qualitative interviews are conducted with a total of four people as well as transcription to
                    determine direction of our work with the project. </p>
                <p>After the interview and transcription, we used thematization to find multiple themes, which we later
                    compared to find the best methods to convey information on the redesign.</p>

                <h4>Structure</h4>
                <p>Based of the customer meeting and the research, we were able to move forward with redesigning the
                    structure of the website.</p>

                <h4>Affinity diagram</h4>
                <p>In order to generate new ideas and improve the product, we use an Affinity Diagram to have an
                    overview of changes we need to make.</p>

                <h4>Content sitemap</h4>
                <p>After sorting and updating our content, we created a Content Sitemap to provide a visual overview of
                    what content should be placed on each page. The content topics are shown by yellow labels with the
                    topic heading written in the middle and the same with subtopics that are green.</p>

                <h4>Design</h4>
                <p>With the research and structure done, we moved on to the design for the redesign.</p>

                <h4>Design (Website)</h4>
                <p>For our design process, we made use of prototyping with an iterative process. We made two versions of
                    our prototype, the original one that we make based on our research and a refined version based on
                    user tests. The first version of the prototype, is made in low fidelity with both sketches and
                    wireframes, which then was developed into a Mock-up. The second version will be a more refined
                    mock-up made based on the feedback from a series of Think Aloud tests.</p>

                <h4>Solution</h4>
                <p>We managed to redesign the costumers old website with new and improved information architecture,
                    functionality and visual design.</p>

                <h4>Coding</h4>
                <p>In terms of code, we made use of the classics tecnologies such html, css and JavaScript, but we also
                    made use of a compenation of CMS and Wordpress to generate some of the site content.
                </p>
                <p>This combination worked by fetching data from Wordpress through API and then being displayed on the
                    site</p>
